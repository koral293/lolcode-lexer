An simple lexer for LOLCODE programming language
It allows to do few simple operations:
- Displaying variables and text strings
- Initializing, declaring and assigning variables such as strings, integers, and float-point numbers
- Displaying some special characters like newline ( , or :) ) and tabulators ( :> )
- Writing comments
